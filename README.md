**Python framework for graph analytics and co-occurrence analysis.**

Blue Graph is a Python framework for graph analytics and co-occurrence analysis consolidating capabilities from different graph processing backends under a unified API. Using Blue Graph, users can gain insights, uncover hidden patterns, infer implicit knowledge and build recommendations engines from graph-shaped data. Blue Graph is already successfully being used to perform Knowledge Graph guided literature reviews, which involves building, exploring and analyzing knowledge graphs from text.

**Building and Using Knowledge Graphs made easy.**

Knowledge Graphs are often built from heterogeneous data and knowledge (i.e. data models such as ontologies, schemas) coming from different sources and often with different formats (i.e. structured, unstructured). Nexus Forge enables data scientists, data and knowledge engineers to address these challenges by uniquely combining under a consistent and generic Python Framework all necessary components to build and search a Knowledge Graph.
